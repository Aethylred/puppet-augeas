= Augeas Puppet module =

== Usage ==

  include augeas

== Description ==

This module does 3 things:

 o ensure correct packages are installed for augeas.

 o backports augeas type from puppet rev cf648279 which fixes issue #1826
   One must have "pluginsync=true" in puppet.conf for this to work.
 
 o creates /usr/share/augeas/lenses/contrib in which other modules can put
   custom lenses (see puppet-mysql/puppet-haproxy for working examples).

The idea is to override this class to include your specific needs. Example:

class augeas::my-redhat inherits augeas::base {

  Package["augeas"] {
    require => Yumrepo["epel-fedora-testing"],
    tag => "install-augeas",
    ensure => "0.4.1-1.el5";
  }
}

class augeas::my-debian inherits augeas::base {

  Package["libaugeas0"] {
    ensure => "latest";
  }
  Package["libaugeas-ruby1.8"] {
    ensure => "0.2.0-2";
  }
}
